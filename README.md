# Plotly-Belly-Button-Bio-Diversity

## Project Overview

In this module, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 
The focus was to help analyze bacterial species living in the navel of candidates for research about meat protein synthesis from human bacteria.
